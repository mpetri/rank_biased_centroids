# Rank-Biased Centroids (RBC)

The Rank-Biased Centroids (RBC) rank fusion method to combine multiple-rankings of objects.

This code implements the RBC rank fusion method, as described in:

The fundamental step in the working of RBC is the usage a `persistence`
parameter (`p` or `phi`) to to fusion multiple ranked lists based only on rank information.

Quote from the paper:

> Each item at rank 1 <= x <= n when the rankings are over n items, we suggest that a geometrically decaying weight function be employed, with the distribution of d over depths x given by (1 âˆ’ p) p^{x-1} for some value 0 <= p <= 1 determined by considering the purpose for which the fused ranking is being constructed. 

For example (also taken from the paper) for diffent rank orderings (R1-R4) of items A-G:

|Rank| R1  | R2  | R3  | R4  |
| ---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1  |  A  |  B  |  A  |  G  |
| 2  |  D  |  D  |  B  |  D  |
| 3  |  B  |  E  |  D  |  E  |
| 4  |  C  |  C  |  C  |  A  |
| 5  |  G  |  -  |  G  |  F  |
| 6  |  F  |  -  |  F  |  C  |
| 7  |  -  |  -  |  E  |  -  |

Depending on the persistence parameter `p` will result in different output orderings based
on each items accumulated weights:

|Rank|   p=0.6   | p=0.8   | p=0.9   |
| ---| ------    | ------  | ------  |
| 1  |  A(0.89)  | D(0.61) | D(0.35) |
| 2  |  D(0.89)  | A(0.50) | C(0.28) |
| 3  |  B(0.89)  | B(0.49) | A(0.27) |
| 4  |  G(0.89)  | C(0.37) | B(0.27) |
| 5  |  E(0.89)  | G(0.37) | G(0.23) |
| 6  |  C(0.89)  | E(0.31) | E(0.22) |
| 7  |  F(0.89)  | F(0.21) | F(0.18) |

# Example:


```rust
use rank_biased_centroids::rbc_with_scores;

let r1 = vec!['A', 'D', 'B', 'C', 'G', 'F'];
let r2 = vec!['B', 'D', 'E', 'C'];
let r3 = vec!['A', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'G', 'F', 'E'];
let r4 = vec!['G', 'D', 'E', 'A', 'F', 'C'];
let p = 0.9;
let result = rbc_with_scores(vec![r1, r2, r3, r4], p).unwrap();
let expected = vec![
    ('D', 0.35),
    ('C', 0.28),
    ('A', 0.27),
    ('B', 0.27),
    ('G', 0.23),
    ('E', 0.22),
    ('F', 0.18),
];
for ((c, s), (expected_c, expected_score)) in result.into_iter().zip(expected.into_iter()) {
    assert_eq!(c, expected_c);
    approx::assert_abs_diff_eq!(s, expected_score, epsilon = 0.005);
}
